                    <p>Welcome to our wedding website! We are so excited to have our dearest friends and family gather to celebrate our special day. Here you will find all of the information needed about the wedding and for a fun-filled, relaxing time in sunny San Diego. We can't wait!</p>

                    <p>John and I met through mutual friends at a festival in San Francisco. There was an immediate attraction, and I couldn't help but notice the sweet and attentive way he treated me throughout the day. By the end of the night, I really didn't want him to leave my side. Lucky for me he hasn't since! We've spent almost 4 years traveling, hiking, city walking, wine drinking, learning, and enjoying each other's company. After an amazing day at Iguazu Falls on our trip to Argentina last June, John caught me by surprise with an incredibly special proposal. I can't wait to see what life has in store for us as a family!</p>

                    <p>Lindsay and I met more than three years ago in San Francisco.  Our first date was on the Summer Solstice, 2011.  I remember walking up to her doorstep that day and thinking that this might be my last ever first date - Lindsay was perfect and I knew it.</p>

                    <p>We both love to travel and to see new places.  During our time together, we have traveled as much as our schedules have allowed.  As we were planning our latest trip to Argentina, I knew this was the perfect place to propose and start our new lives together.  We were engaged on June 25th, 2014 at Iguazu Falls.</p>

                    <p>We are both so happy to be sharing this special day with our family and friends!</p>
